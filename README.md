## 2. Establish project principles
```
/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on Japanese OCR accuracy, form structure detection, user privacy, and reliable CSV export quality
```

## 3. Create the spec
```
/speckit.specify Build an application that processes Japanese forms and documents through OCR to extract structured data into CSV files. Users upload images or PDFs containing Japanese text (forms, handwritten notes, business documents), the app detects text regions and form fields, performs accurate Japanese OCR, and exports organized data as CSV with customizable column mappings.
```

## 4. Create a technical implementation plan
```
/speckit.plan Use Python with Tkinter for the desktop GUI, Tesseract OCR with Japanese language packs for text recognition, OpenCV for image preprocessing and form detection, and pandas for CSV export. Focus on offline processing with no cloud dependencies.
```

## 5. Break down into tasks
```
/speckit.tasks
```

## 6. Execute implementation
```
/speckit.implement
```
