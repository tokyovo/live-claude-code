# Multi-Language OCR Form Processing Application

This project demonstrates building a multi-language OCR form processing application using [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for vibe coding with Claude Code.

## 1. Setup spec-kit

Follow the spec-kit installation instructions to set up the workflow commands in your Claude Code environment.

## 2. Establish project principles
```
/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on multi-language OCR accuracy, form structure detection, user privacy, and reliable CSV export quality
```

## 3. Create the spec
```
/speckit.specify Build an application that processes multi-language forms and documents through OCR to extract structured data into CSV files. Users upload images or PDFs containing text in various languages (forms, handwritten notes, business documents), the app detects text regions and form fields, performs accurate multi-language OCR, and exports organized data as CSV with customizable column mappings.
```

## 4. Create a technical implementation plan
```
/speckit.plan Use Next.js (latest version) for the web application with shadcn/ui for modern UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling. Implement OCR functionality using Vercel AI SDK. Use React Hook Form for form handling, Zustand for state management, and export functionality with Papa Parse for CSV generation. Focus on responsive design with drag-and-drop file uploads and real-time processing feedback.
```

## 5. Break down into tasks
```
/speckit.tasks
```

## 6. Execute implementation
```
/speckit.implement
```
